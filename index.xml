osu!uwaterloo will be back for clubs and societies day this fall! While we do not have a confirmed booth location yet, we will most likely have a booth! Drop by to play a bit of osu! on our super awesome PC setup and show off your skills to all the passer-by-ers, or just say hi and meet some of our existing members.</description></item></channel></rss>
